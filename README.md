# Sample Questions:
## Answer against each questions
> 1. What possibly is a **Toolchain** and how does it fit into our workflow?
> 2. What is *github* and why is it important to our course?  ~github is bad tool~ 
> 3. Why do we need to put our *colab code into the github account? Why not just leave it at Colab?
> 4. I noticed weâ€™re using the Apache license in our homework - what does that mean? What are the other licenses and when do we typically consider them?
> 5. The video does not describe about what Branches are in github - what is the purpose and when do we use them?
